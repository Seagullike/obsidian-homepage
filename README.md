## Homepage Obsidian Plugin

Opens a specified note upon launching Obsidian, instead of the most recent note.

## Usage

By default, this plugin opens a note called `Home` in the root directory on startup. This can be changed via the `Open on startup` plugin setting. If the specified note is nonexistent, it will be created.
