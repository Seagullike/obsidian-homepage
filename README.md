## Homepage Obsidian Plugin

Opens a specified note upon launching Obsidian, instead of the most recent note.

## Usage

By default, this plugin opens a note called `Home` in the root directory on startup. This can be changed in the plugin settings:

* Enable `Use workspaces` to open a workspace of that name instead.
* Use `Open on startup` to change the note or workspace to open. If a specified note is nonexistent, it will be created.
